# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the usage of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries when the array is empty.  The issue is that an empty array used with `$in` will return zero results, regardless of the existence of the field in the documents.

The `bug.js` file showcases the incorrect implementation leading to this issue, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected approach.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.js` to see the unexpected behavior.
3. Run `bugSolution.js` to observe the correct implementation. 

## Solution
The solution involves checking for an empty array before performing the query. If the array is empty, you can adapt your query logic to handle that case. This might involve returning all documents or handling the scenario appropriately according to your application's requirements.  See `bugSolution.js` for an example.
